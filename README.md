# Paginated PDFBox Table Generator

This is meant to be a simple sample of how to use PDFBox to generate paginated tables. I haven't optimized or developed to code very much, but it's a working model and can be used to get some ideas on how to implement table generation using PDFBox.

This project requires pdfbox-app-1.8.4.jar
